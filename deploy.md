Great — Caddy is **excellent** for hosting a Next.js or React (Node.js) project. You don’t need to replace your Node server — just let Caddy act as a **reverse proxy** in front of it, **automatically handling SSL and routing**.

---

### ✅ Your Setup (React/Next.js on Node)

Let’s say:

* You run your Node server on `localhost:3000` (Next.js default)
* You want:

  * `yourdomain.com` → your Next.js app
  * Automatic HTTPS
  * No need to mess with acme.sh or Certbot

---

### 🛠 Example `Caddyfile`

```caddyfile
yourdomain.com {
  reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

That’s it.

### 🔄 Steps to Replace Nginx with Caddy

1. **Stop Nginx** (if running):

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop nginx
   sudo systemctl disable nginx
   ```

2. **Install Caddy**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
   curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
   curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install caddy
   ```

3. **Edit your Caddyfile**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
   ```

   Paste:

   ```caddyfile
   yourdomain.com {
     reverse_proxy localhost:3000
   }
   ```

4. **Run or restart your Node server**, e.g.:

   ```bash
   npm run build && npm start
   ```

5. **Reload Caddy**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload caddy
   ```

### 🧠 Bonus

Caddy will:

* Automatically issue a Let’s Encrypt cert
* Serve over HTTPS
* Renew the cert before expiry
* Forward requests to your Node backend

---
Perfect — keeping Cloudflare is a good choice for performance, DDoS protection, and caching. Here’s how to make sure **Cloudflare works smoothly with your Caddy + Node.js setup**:

---

### ✅ Ideal Cloudflare + Caddy Setup

#### 🔐 1. **Set SSL Mode to “Full (Strict)”**

* Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard → SSL/TLS → Overview**
* Set it to: **Full (Strict)**

This ensures:

* Cloudflare connects to your Caddy server using a valid HTTPS cert (issued by Let’s Encrypt)
* Avoids “redirect loops” or insecure fallback

---

#### 🌐 2. **DNS Settings**

In **DNS tab**, make sure:

* `A` record for `metacode.fun` → your server IP
* The cloud icon is **orange** (proxied by Cloudflare)

Example:

| Type | Name | Value           | Proxy Status |
| ---- | ---- | --------------- | ------------ |
| A    | @    | 123.123.123.123 | Proxied      |

---

#### ⚙️ 3. **Caddyfile – Keep It Simple**

You only need this:

```caddyfile
metacode.fun {
  reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

Caddy will:

* Issue and renew certs (Cloudflare forwards HTTPS requests)
* Serve your Next.js app through reverse proxy

---

#### 🔁 4. **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**

Caddy does this automatically if port 80 is open.

Make sure:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
```

---

#### 🧪 5. **Test It**

Try:

```bash
curl -I https://metacode.fun
```

You should see:

* `server: cloudflare`
* Your actual app’s headers (e.g., `x-powered-by`, etc.)

Visit in browser — should be secure and fast.

---

### 🧠 Optional (Nice-to-Have)

* Add a `www` version:

```caddyfile
metacode.fun, www.metacode.fun {
  reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

* Redirect `www` to non-www:

```caddyfile
www.metacode.fun {
  redir https://metacode.fun{uri}
}
metacode.fun {
  reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

---

Let me know if you want help adding subdomains like `api.metacode.fun` or enabling cache headers.

To copy all project files (e.g., your Next.js/React app) to a remote Ubuntu server, use `scp` or `rsync` over SSH.

---

### ✅ Option 1: `scp` (simple and fast)

```bash
scp -r ./my-project-folder username@your.server.ip:/home/username/
```

* `-r`: Recursive (includes all files and subfolders)
* Replace `username` with your Ubuntu username (e.g. `ubuntu`)
* Replace `your.server.ip` with your server’s public IP
* Destination path can be anywhere writable (e.g. `/var/www/`, `/home/ubuntu/`)

---

### ✅ Option 2: `rsync` (faster for repeated uploads)

```bash
rsync -avz ./my-project-folder/ username@your.server.ip:/home/username/my-project-folder/
```

* `-a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, symlinks, etc.)
* `-v`: Verbose output
* `-z`: Compress during transfer

💡 If you rerun `rsync`, it only sends changed files — much faster for updates.

---

### 📁 After Uploading

1. SSH into your server:

   ```bash
   ssh username@your.server.ip
   ```

2. Go to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/my-project-folder
   ```

3. Install dependencies and build:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

💡 For production, consider using **PM2** to keep the server running:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name "my-app" -- start
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

Would you like a quick script that bundles rsync + SSH setup + PM2 launch?
